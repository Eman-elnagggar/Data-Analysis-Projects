# Coffee Shop Sales Project

The coffee shop sales project involves analyzing the first six months of data from the coffee shop.  
The source of data is a Maven analytics website guided project https://app.mavenanalytics.io/guided-projects/72ec0a0d-bc7d-4ac4-a8da-da811f9061d6.

I made two Excel files to get data insights:  

1) coffee shop sales file:  
   This file is built to answer the core questions presented in the Maven Analytics guided project. It includes:  
   - Monthly Revenue – Revenue trends over the 6-months.  
   - Top Product Types by Revenue – Products contributing most to sales.  
   - No transactions per product category.  
   - No transactions per day of the week.  
   - No transactions per Hour of the day.  

2) Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard:  
   This file offers a broader view of the business performance, which focuses on getting most of the data insights as general and has three dashboards  

   2.1) Product Dashboard, it includes:  
   - The top 10 Transaction quantity products.  
   - The top 10 Revenue products.  
   - The least 10 transaction quantity products.  
   - The last 10 Revenue products.  
   - The highest quantity of products with low Revenue.  
   - the lowest quantity product with low revenue.  

   2.2) Sales dashboard, it includes:  
   Analysis of the revenue of products based on:  
   - Day of the week.  
   - no of weeks.  
   - hours.  
   - Months.  

   2.3) Category product dashboard, it includes:  
   - the average revenue per product category.  
   - the sum of revenue per product category.  

   All three dashboards are sliced with the location of the store.
